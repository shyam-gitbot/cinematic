# Retro Movie Picker 🎬

Retro Cinema Picker is a lightweight, single-file web application designed to solve the "what should I watch?" dilemma. Wrapped in a nostalgic, 80s-style CRT interface, it randomly selects high-rated movies for you from the TMDB, a large database of movies , allowing you to track what you've seen, skip what you dislike, and build a watchlist.

## ✨ Features

- **📺 Retro Aesthetic:** CRT scanlines, neon glows, and digital noise effects for an immersive experience
- **♾️ Hybrid Database:** Comes with a built-in curated list of classics, but seamlessly expands to thousands of movies if a TMDB API key is provided
- **💾 Local Persistence:** Uses browser localStorage to remember your "Watched", "Skipped", and "Watchlist" movies without needing a backend server
- **⚡ Zero-Config Deployment:** The entire app lives in a single index.html file. Perfect for GitHub Pages
- **📱 Responsive Design:** Looks great on desktop and mobile devices
- **🧠 Smart Filtering:** Automatically excludes movies you've already seen or skipped

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

### 1. Quick Start (Local)

2. Open it in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
3. Enjoy!

### 2. Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Upload `index.html` to the repository
3. Go to **Settings** > **Pages**
4. Under **Source**, select `main` branch and `/` (root)
5. Click **Save** — your site will be live in minutes!

## ⚙️ Configuration (Optional)

To unlock the infinite movie database, you need a free API key from [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api).

1. Open `index.html` in a text editor (Notepad, VS Code, etc.)
2. Find the configuration section around line 280:

```javascript
// ==========================================
// CONFIGURATION: API KEY
// ==========================================
const TMDB_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
```

3. Paste your key inside the quotes
4. Save the file — the "LOCAL DB" indicator in the app header will switch to "TMDB CONNECTED"
